    "# Gillespe ABM Explainer\n",
    "This notebook explains an implementation of the Gillespe ABM in detail. The example used is a model of HIV and HCV transmission in a population of injecting drug users. The purpose of this explainer is to describe the archiatecture of the script can be understood and hopefully be adapted to other systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Gillespe ABM?\n",
    "The Gillespe ABM is an agent based model (ABM) that uses the Gillespe algorithm for relatively fast computation. It is an ABM in the sense that each individual (agent) in the modelled population has their own identity and set of attributes. Agents interact with each other through network connections. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a Gillespe algorithm in the sense that the system can be described a a set of poisson processes which occur at given rates. The algorithm sequentially produces events generated by these processes. The rate associated with each process may be affected by other events as they occur. The main difference between the Gillespe ABM and a normal Gillespe algorithm is that each individual in the population has their own set of processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Features of this model\n",
    "The features included in this model are summarised in this diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"compartmental.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a network agents distributed across 8 compartments. Compartments describe the disease status of the agent with respect to 2 diseases (2 HCV states S or I, and 4 HIV states S, A, C and R). Agents transition between compartments at given rates, some of these rates are fixed values, others change depending on the compartments of the agent's network neighbours. The are also initiations (represented by the diagonal arrows), and cessations (represented by the black circles).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initiation (creating new agents)\n",
    "One of the features of this model is that new agents are be created throughout the duration of the simulation. We need to define how this works before we can move on, but if you are not interested in these details then you can move on to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start with a simple example with two agents, 1 and 2 who share a network connection. The starting compartment of each node and the network neighbours of each node are stored as follows"
