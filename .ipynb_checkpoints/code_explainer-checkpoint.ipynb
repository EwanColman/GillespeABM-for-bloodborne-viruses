    "# Gillespe ABM Explainer\n",
    "This notebook explains an implementation of the Gillespe ABM in detail. The example used is a model of HIV and HCV transmission in a population of injecting drug users. The purpose of this explainer is to describe the basic archiatecture of the model with a working example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Gillespe ABM?\n",
    "The Gillespe ABM is an agent based model (ABM) that uses the Gillespe algorithm for relatively fast computation. It is an ABM in the sense that each individual (agent) in the modelled population has their own identity and set of attributes. Agents interact with each other through network connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a Gillespe algorithm in the sense that the system can be described a set of Poisson processes which occur at given rates. The algorithm sequentially produces events generated by these processes. The rate associated with each process may be affected by other events as they occur. The main difference between the Gillespe ABM and a normal Gillespe algorithm is that each individual in the population has their own set of processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features of the model\n",
    "The features included in this model are summarised in this diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"compartmental.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a network agents distributed across 8 compartments. Compartments describe the disease status of the agent with respect to 2 diseases (2 HCV states S or I, and 4 HIV states S, A, C and R). Agents transition between compartments at given rates, some of these rates are fixed values, others change depending on the compartments of the agent's network neighbours. The are also initiations (represented by the diagonal arrows), and cessations (represented by the black circles).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initiation (creating new agents)\n",
    "One of the features of this model is that new agents are be created throughout the duration of the simulation. We need to define how this works before we can move on, but if you are not interested in these details then you can move on to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to set some parameters. New agents enter the system with disease statuses given by the folowing probabilities"
